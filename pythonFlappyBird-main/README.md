## Help with git

You can checkout the [git instructions](/docs/gitInstructions.md) for a list of
commands to help you get started with git. 

If you have a suggestion for more git commands to document, [create a new issue here](https://github.com/CoffeeCodeRpt/pythonFlappyBird/issues/new).

## Testing Python

To test to make sure Python is working correctly, run the `test.py` file in the
root directory. It should print `Hello World!` to your console.
